                <h2>Maria: From Challenges to Top-cleaner of the Year ✨</h2>
            </header>
            <p>Maria, originally from Cuiabá, Brazil, moved to California with the promise of working as a nanny. But
                soon, she realized that things wouldn't be as she had imagined…
            </p>
            <P>Far from home, feeling discouraged and unsure of her path, she discovered Flash Guys in 2023 and applied
                to join as a helper.
            </P>
            <P><em>“At first, it was very difficult,”</em> she admits. Maria had no prior experience, and her English
                was still
                limited. But Flash believed in her and provided the support she needed to overcome each challenge!</P>
            <p>Through hard work and the encouragement of her team, Maria conquered every obstacle. In less than a year,
                we're proud to celebrate her as one of our top cleaners. <em>“Flash was the opportunity I so desperately
                    needed. It was my light at the end of the tunnel,”</em> she shares emotionally.</p>
