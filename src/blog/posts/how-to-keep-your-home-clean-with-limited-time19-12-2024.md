## Divide Tasks

Rather than attempting to clean the entire house in one go, distribute tasks throughout the week. This not only makes cleaning more manageable but also prevents clutter from accumulating.

## Prioritize High-Traffic Areas

Focus on the areas of your home that experience the most foot traffic, such as the kitchen where meals are prepared and the bathroom, which sees daily use. By prioritizing these spaces, you'll notice a significant improvement in overall cleanliness.

## Keep Cleaning Products Accessible

Ensure essential cleaning supplies are readily available by storing them in a basket or bucket within easy reach. This allows you to swiftly access them whenever needed.

## Establish a Daily Routine

Dedicate a few minutes each morning or evening to tackle quick tasks, such as wiping down kitchen counters, vacuuming main floors, or cleaning the bathroom. This consistent effort prevents dirt buildup and saves time in the long run.

## Don't Neglect Regular Maintenance

Remember to routinely change bed sheets, clean air conditioning filters, and conduct deep cleaning sessions a few times a year.
Maintaining a clean home with limited time available can be challenging, but it's certainly achievable. By implementing straightforward and efficient strategies such as task division, prioritizing high-traffic areas, and establishing a daily cleaning routine you can ensure your home remains spotless, even on the busiest of days.
