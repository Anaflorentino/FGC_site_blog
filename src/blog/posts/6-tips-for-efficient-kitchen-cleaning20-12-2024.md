## Organize the Pantry

Keep food and ingredients organized in transparent containers. Label each item for easy identification and keep frequently used products within reach.

Disinfect Surfaces

Use an appropriate disinfectant to clean kitchen surfaces such as countertops, sinks, and tables. Wipe countertops with a damp cloth and mild detergent.

## Deep Clean Appliances

**Regularly, deep clean appliances such as refrigerator, stove, oven, and microwave.**

Remove all trays and shelves and wash with soap and water. Clean the interior of the appliances with a damp cloth and mild detergent.

**Don't Forget the Oven**: Remove the racks and apply a specific oven cleaner. Let the product sit according to the manufacturer's instructions and then wipe with a damp cloth.

## Wash Dishes Regularly

Avoid accumulating dirty dishes in the sink. Wash dishes, cutlery, and pots after use or put them in the dishwasher immediately. This prevents dirt buildup and facilitates daily kitchen cleaning.

## Keep the Floor Clean

Sweep or vacuum the kitchen floor daily to remove dirt and crumbs. After cleaning, wipe with a damp cloth and disinfectant to ensure the floor stays clean.
Do a Weekly Deep Clean

Once a week, dedicate time for a deep clean of the kitche. This includes cleaning the extractor fan, washing curtains, cleaning the interior of cabinets and drawers, among other tasks.

With these 6 simple tips, you can keep your kitchen clean and organized all the time, providing a safe and pleasant environment for cooking.
