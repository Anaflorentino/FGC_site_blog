## Arrange Pillows and Throws



Fold throws and elegantly arrange them over the back of the sofa. Pillows can be neatly arranged on the sofa to create an aesthetically pleasing look that invites relaxation.



## Keeping Surfaces Clean and Uncluttered



Avoid cluttering coffee and side tables with too many items. Keep only essential pieces such as decorative books or a vase with fresh flowers. Regularly wipe down surfaces with a damp cloth to remove dust and dirt.



## Decorative Objects



Select decorative objects that complement the style of the room and arrange them in a balanced and harmonious manner.



## Strategies for Keeping Upholstery Clean

Regularly wash pillow covers and throws. Clean spills immediately with a damp cloth and mild detergent.

With these simple tips and strategies, you can keep your living room always tidy and inviting, creating a space where you and your guests can relax and enjoy special moments together.
