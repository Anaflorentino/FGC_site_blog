Sanitize the sink, toilet, and shower with a multi-purpose cleaner or a solution of water and vinegar to disinfect the surfaces. Clean the mirrors and regularly replace the towels. This daily practice will help prevent the accumulation of dirt and bacteria, keeping the bathroom always fresh.

To prevent the emergence of these fungi, it's important to ventilate the bathroom well after showering, leaving the door or window open. Additionally, it's recommended to regularly clean the tiles with a mixture of water and baking soda, which helps remove stains and prevent mold growth.
