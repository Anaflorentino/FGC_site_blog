## Better for Your Health

Conventional cleaning products often contain harsh chemicals that can irritate the skin, eyes, and respiratory system. Eco-friendly alternatives offer a safer choice because they:



- Use **natural ingredients** like plant-based surfactants and essential oils.

- Are free from harmful chemicals like ammonia, bleach, and synthetic fragrances.

- Reduce exposure to toxins that can trigger allergies or worsen asthma.



## Safer for Children and Pets

Kids and pets are more vulnerable to the effects of harsh cleaning products. Since they often come into closer contact with floors and surfaces, eco-friendly cleaners can provide peace of mind by:



- Minimizing chemical residues.

- Offering non-toxic solutions for everyday cleaning.



## Reduces Environmental Impact

Cleaning products don‚Äôt just disappear after use‚Äîthey end up in our water systems and ecosystems. Eco-friendly options are designed to:



- Be **biodegradable**, breaking down naturally without polluting the environment.

- Avoid harsh chemicals that harm aquatic life.

- Use sustainable packaging, such as recyclable or compostable materials.



## Improves Indoor Air Quality

### How to Choose Eco-Friendly Cleaning Products

- **Ingredient transparency**: Reputable brands list all ingredients on their packaging.
