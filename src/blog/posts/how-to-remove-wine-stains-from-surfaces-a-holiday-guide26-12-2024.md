## 1. Act Quickly for Best Results



- The faster you address a wine stain, the easier it will be to remove.

- Blot (don‚Äôt rub!) the stain immediately with a clean cloth or paper towel to soak up as much liquid as possible.

- Avoid scrubbing, as this can push the wine deeper into the fabric or surface.



## 2. Removing Wine Stains from Fabric and Linens

### Red Wine:



- **Salt Method**:

- Generously sprinkle salt over the wet stain to absorb the wine.

- Let it sit for 15-30 minutes, then rinse with cold water.

- **Baking Soda Paste**:

- Mix baking soda and water to form a paste. Apply it to the stain and let it dry before rinsing.

- **Vinegar and Dish Soap**:

- Mix one part white vinegar with two parts water and a small drop of dish soap. Blot the stain gently with this solution.### White Wine:



- Surprisingly, white wine can help dilute red wine stains. Pour a small amount over the red wine stain before blotting and cleaning with your preferred method.

## 3. Removing Wine Stains from Carpets

### Red Wine:



- **Club Soda**:

- Pour club soda directly onto the stain. Its carbonation helps lift the wine while the salt content prevents it from setting. Blot gently with a clean towel.

- **Hydrogen Peroxide and Dish Soap**:

- Mix one part hydrogen peroxide with one part dish soap. Apply to the stain, blotting gently. Rinse with water and blot dry.### White Wine:



- Use a damp cloth soaked in soapy water to blot the stain. Repeat as needed and finish with a dry towel to absorb excess moisture.

## 4. Removing Wine Stains from Upholstery

### Red Wine:



- **Alcohol Method**:

- Dab the stain with a small amount of rubbing alcohol to break down the pigments. Blot with a clean cloth soaked in water to rinse.

- **Specialized Cleaners**:

- Use a fabric-safe stain remover specifically designed for upholstery. Always test a small area first to ensure it won‚Äôt damage the material.### White Wine:



- Mix a solution of mild dish soap and warm water. Blot the stain gently, working from the outside in to avoid spreading.



## 5. Removing Wine Stains from Hard Surfaces

### Wooden Tables and Floors:



- Wipe up the spill immediately with a damp cloth.

- For lingering stains, use a mixture of baking soda and water as a gentle scrub. Avoid harsh chemicals that might damage the finish.### Countertops:



- **Granite or Marble**:

- Blot the spill and clean with a pH-neutral cleaner. Avoid acidic solutions like vinegar, which can damage natural stone.

- **Laminate or Other Surfaces**:

- Use a mild dish soap solution or a specialized cleaner for stubborn stains.



## 6. Pro Tips for the Holidays

### Be Prepared:



- Keep stain removal essentials on hand: baking soda, club soda, white vinegar, hydrogen peroxide, and microfiber cloths.

- Set up a designated spot for guests to place their drinks, reducing the risk of spills.### Holiday-Specific Stains:



- For wine-soaked **napkins or tablecloths**, wash them as soon as possible with a pre-treatment stain remover.

- Consider using **dark or patterned linens** during parties to camouflage potential spills.



## 7. When All Else Fails



- For stubborn stains, don‚Äôt hesitate to call a professional cleaner. They have the tools and expertise to restore your surfaces to their pre-spill glory.

## Final Thoughts

Wine spills don‚Äôt have to be a holiday nightmare. With these quick and effective tips, you can remove stains and get back to enjoying the festivities in no time. So pour yourself another glass, keep the cleaning kit nearby, and celebrate the season worry-free! üç∑‚ú®
