## Plan Before You Begin
Deep cleaning isn‚Äôt a race; it‚Äôs a marathon. Start by making a plan:
[ml][li indent=0 align=left]**List the areas** you want to clean, room by room.[/li][li indent=0 align=left]**Gather your supplies**: Stock up on cleaning products, gloves, trash bags, and storage bins.[/li][li indent=0 align=left]Dedicate a **realistic timeframe**: A weekend or a few hours each day works well.[/li][/ml][h3]
[/h3]
## Declutter First
Cleaning is much easier without clutter in the way. Follow these steps:

[/h3]
## Start with High-Traffic Areas

Deep cleaning means tackling spots often overlooked during regular cleaning. Pay attention to:

[/h3]
## Organize as You Go
Deep cleaning is the perfect time to introduce organization into your home:
[ml][li indent=0 align=left]Use **storage bins** to group similar items together.[/li][li indent=0 align=left]Label shelves or containers for easy access.[/li][li indent=0 align=left]Arrange items based on frequency of use‚Äîkeep daily essentials within reach.[/li][/ml][h3]
[/h3]
## Add a Fresh Touch
Once everything is clean and organized, give your home an inviting feel:
[ml][li indent=0 align=left]Place **air fresheners** or diffuse essential oils for a subtle, pleasant scent.[/li][li indent=0 align=left]Add a vase of fresh **flowers** or a potted plant for a lively touch.[/li][li indent=0 align=left]Replace old **doormats** or cushions to refresh your decor.[/li][/ml][h3]
[/h3]
