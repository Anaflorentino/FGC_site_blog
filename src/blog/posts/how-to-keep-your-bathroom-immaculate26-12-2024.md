## Daily Cleaning
Sanitize the sink, toilet, and shower with a multi-purpose cleaner or a solution of water and vinegar to disinfect the surfaces. Clean the mirrors and regularly replace the towels. This daily practice will help prevent the accumulation of dirt and bacteria, keeping the bathroom always fresh.
## Combat Mold and Mildew
To prevent the emergence of these fungi, it's important to ventilate the bathroom well after showering, leaving the door or window open. Additionally, it's recommended to regularly clean the tiles with a mixture of water and baking soda, which helps remove stains and prevent mold growth.
## Use Natural Cleaning Products
Products like vinegar, baking soda, and lemon juice are effective in removing stains and odors, as well as being gentler on the environment. Try making your own cleaning solution by mixing equal parts of white vinegar and water. This mixture can be used to clean all bathroom surfaces, leaving them clean and shiny. With these simple and effective tips, you can keep your bathroom immaculate and hygienic all year round. A clean bathroom not only provides comfort but also contributes to the health and well-being of the whole family.
